# Northeastern Micro-conference on Journalism, Interactivity, Design and Civic Engagement

##Embedded in ARTE 5901-01 Special Topics: StoryLab
Ryder Hall, Room 324
Tuesday, January 20, 2015
6:00 to 9:00 p.m.
Participation limited to students and invited discussants.

##Raison d'être
Journalism is being reinvented. The way it’s made, the way it’s disseminated, the way it’s consumed. Wading into the 21st century, media makers are experimenting with new platforms, learning new tools, developing new skills, and developing new relationships with their subjects, colleagues, and readers. To innovate, we must be bold, curious, fearless. At StoryLab, we believe we must listen and learn from other disciplines. We believe in the cross-pollination of ideas to drive experimentation and reflection. We’ve convened this micro-conference to set the context of the course, answer questions, and provoke further inquiry: what can journalists and documentary storytellers learn from other disciplines? We’ll explore innovation in news, dynamic storytelling, interaction design, information design, and civic engagement.

##Sequence of events
After a very brief welcome, we start with short presentations from each speaker, 7 minutes MAXIMUM! The idea is to get people thinking, and then continue to engage with the students and other discussants in a dynamic, moderated conversation.  There will be a break for coffee, tea, snacks between the presentations and the discussion period. After the discussion, Aleszu and David will provide closing remarks and a  summary of key points.
